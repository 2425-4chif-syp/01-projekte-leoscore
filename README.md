## Goals 
We want to get a great overview for the user so they can see all the live stats for Basketball, Darts and Football. The user should be able to mark his favorite players and his favorite teams and then he should be able to see the teams he has marked first so that he is always up to date.

### Static part
- The static part of our website shows all the different sports and the results, stats of the players and more.

### Dynamic part
- The Dynamic part of our website is the postgre database that stores the user data with the favorite players favorite teams and more. We also want to store old games and stats from the finished games.

## Main tasks
